## Implementation

* System layers
  * Hardware: Servers and networks
    * Scaling (adding new nodes) should not affect consistency of other layers
    * Degradation (removing nodes)  should not affect consistency of other layers
    * Monitoring
      * Hardware
      * Network
      * Resources and load
    * Alerting policy
  * Cluster: Services management system  ([Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io/), alternatives: [OpenShift](https://www.openshift.com),[Apache Mesos/Apache Karaf](http://servicemix.apache.org/))
    * Monitoring
      * Availability of each node in the cluster
      * All services up and running
      * Connectivity between different pods and services
      * Public endpoints accessibility
      * Alerting policy

      * Execution environment
        * Meta-project with topology of the system
          * Showroom + Staging
            * Separate namespace for each showroom

## Maintenance

* Disaster recovery plan (how to recover service/database/whole cluster/whole region)
* Release strategy process (canary, blue/green)
* Capacity planning (resources & limits)
* Alerts at least for basic metrics (CPU, memory, IOPS, disk space, restarts, servuces up)

## Security

* Access and application logs must be archived for a minimum of 90 days
* Set HSTS to 31536000 (1 year)
  * `strict-transport-security: max-age=31536000`
* Correctly set client IP
  * Confirm client ip is in the proper location in [X-Forwarded-For](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Forwarded-For), modifying what is sent from the client if needed. AWS and GCP's load balancers will do this automatically.
  * Make sure the web server and the application get the true client IP by configuring trusted IP's within Nginx or Apache
    * Nginx: [ngx_http_realip_module](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_realip_module.html)
    * Apache: [mod_remoteip](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_remoteip.html)
  * If you have a service-oriented architecture, you must always be able to find the IP of the client that sent the initial request. Recommend passing along the `X-Forwarded-For` to all back-end services.
* for [Cookies](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Guidelines/Web_Security#Cookies):
  * Set the Secure and HTTPOnly flags
  * Use a sensible Expiration
  * Use the prefix `__Host-` for the cookie name

## Databases

* All SQL queries must be parameterized, not concatenated
* Applications must use accounts with limited GRANTS when connecting to databases
  * In particular, applications **must not use admin or owner accounts**, to decrease the impact of a sql injection vulnerability.
* User data must be [escaped for the right context](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/XSS_(Cross_Site_Scripting)_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet#XSS_Prevention_Rules_Summary) prior to reflecting it
* Apply sensible limits to user inputs, see [input validation](https://wiki.mozilla.org/WebAppSec/Secure_Coding_Guidelines#Input_Validation)
  * POST body size should be small (<500kB) unless explicitly needed
